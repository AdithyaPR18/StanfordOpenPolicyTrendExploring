# StanfordOpenPolicyTrendExploring


## AI Disclaimer
I used ChatGPT for some of the earlier steps of the project that involve creating datasets as this was my first time using polars. ChatGPT helped me learn how to use polars. Additionally, I used GPT to fine tune the ML model towards the end of the ipynb file.

## IPYNB File Errors
There are issues with the IPYNB file working relative to the original dataset. If it doesn't work, try using the python file I uploaded to this repo!
